#### üíæ Database
Lobby is built using Microsoft Lists as the database due to its accessibility and functionality. However, you have the option to upgrade to Dataverse if preferred. Out of the box, you can manage visitor data via Microsoft Teams which can fully intergrate with Microsoft Lists, where selected members of your organization (such as reception teams) will have full access.

### Instalation 
Installing Lobby is a breeze, and true to No More Bad Mondays style, we've added a touch of magic to make the process even faster. With easy-to-follow step-by-step guides and a few automations to speed things up, you'll have support at every stage.

Registration and feedback forms are just a click away from being available in your environment. After that, you only need to spend a few moments updating the background, logo, and color scheme to match your organisation's branding.

The Microsoft List database includes multiple columns to ensure you have all the data you need. Creating this database could have been time-consuming, but we've included an automation that creates it for you with just one click, including the relevant columns and formatting. From there, a few simple manual steps will complete the setup.

The application itself is a Microsoft Power App that can be easily imported into your environment. With our handy guides, you'll only have a few manual setup steps left before you're ready to go. And don't forget, you can customize Lobby to align with your company's branding too!
