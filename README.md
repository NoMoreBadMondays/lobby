## Features

#### 🎨 Branding
Lobby can be completely customized to match your organization's branding, from colors to images and beyond—without any of our branding! It’s designed to be your company's own. As it’s a Power App, if someone in your organization or a Power App specialist supports your builds, they can extend Lobby with unique features anytime. Alternatively, contact us for full support.

#### 🔍 User Search
Within your Microsoft ecosystem, any user is discoverable for visitors to select at check-in. You can customize this to exclude certain staff members if needed. Lobby is fully integrated with your Office 365 user data, allowing you to display staff names, photos, roles, and more.

#### 🌐 Translations
We’ve laid the groundwork for you to add Microsoft Translator if desired. This means visitors can access Lobby in any language supported by Microsoft Translator—almost every language!

#### 📝 Pre-registration
Pre-register guests and send essential information prior to their visit using Microsoft Forms. This ensures you gather the information you need right away.

#### 💾 Database
Lobby is built using Microsoft Lists as the database due to its accessibility and functionality. However, you have the option to upgrade to Dataverse if preferred. Out of the box, you can manage visitor data via Microsoft Teams, where selected members of your organization (such as reception teams) will have full access.

#### 🔔 Notifications
Leveraging the power of Power Automate, Teams, and Adaptive Cards, Lobby sends real-time notifications to relevant staff members via Microsoft Teams as soon as someone checks in.

#### 🏢 Multiple Sites
Deploy Lobby across multiple campuses. If you have a tablet at reception with internet access, you can use Lobby—it's that simple!
