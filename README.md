## Features

#### üé® Branding
Lobby can be completely customized to match your organization's branding, from colors to images and beyond‚Äîwithout any of our branding! It‚Äôs designed to be your company's own. As it‚Äôs a Power App, if someone in your organization or a Power App specialist supports your builds, they can extend Lobby with unique features anytime. Alternatively, contact us for full support.

#### üíæ Database
Lobby is built using Microsoft Lists as the database due to its accessibility and functionality. However, you have the option to upgrade to Dataverse if preferred. Out of the box, you can manage visitor data via Microsoft Teams, where selected members of your organization (such as reception teams) will have full access.

#### üîî Notifications
Leveraging the power of Power Automate, Teams, and Adaptive Cards, Lobby sends real-time notifications to relevant staff members via Microsoft Teams as soon as someone checks in.
